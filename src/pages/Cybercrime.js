              <div class="mb-10">
                Cybercrime is a crime that involves a computer and a
                network.[1][2] The computer may have been used in the commission
                of a crime, or it may be the target.[3] Cybercrime may harm
                someone's security and financial health.[4][5]
                <br />
                <br />
                There are many privacy concerns surrounding cybercrime when
                confidential information is intercepted or disclosed, lawfully
                or otherwise. Internationally, both governmental and non-state
                actors engage in cybercrimes, including espionage, financial
                theft, and other cross-border crimes. Cybercrimes crossing
                international borders and involving the actions of at least one
                nation-state are sometimes referred to as cyberwarfare. Warren
                Buffett describes cybercrime as the "number one problem with
                mankind"[6] and "poses real risks to humanity."[7] A report
                (sponsored by McAfee) published in 2014 estimated that the
                annual damage to the global economy was $445 billion.[8]
                Approximately $1.5 billion was lost in 2012 to online credit and
                debit card fraud in the US.[9] In 2018, a study by the Center
                for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in partnership
                with McAfee, concludes that nearly one percent of global GDP,
                close to $600 billion, is lost to cybercrime each year.[10] The
                World Economic Forum 2020 Global Risk report confirmed that
                organized Cybercrimes bodies are joining forces to perpetrate
                criminal activities online while estimating the likelihood of
                their detection and prosecution to be less than 1 percent in the
                US.[11]

                With traditional crime reducing, global communities continue to
                witness a sporadic growth in cybercrime.[12] Computer crime
                encompasses a broad range of activities, from financial crimes
                to scams, through cybersex trafficking and ad frauds [13][14]

                Computer fraud is any dishonest misrepresentation of fact
                intended to let another to do or refrain from doing something
                which causes loss. In this context, the fraud will result in
                obtaining a benefit by: Altering in an unauthorized way. This
                requires little technical expertise and is a common form of
                theft by employees altering the data before entry or entering
                false data, or by entering unauthorized instructions or using
                unauthorized processes; Altering, destroying, suppressing, or
                stealing output, usually to conceal unauthorized transactions.
                This is difficult to detect;
                <br />
                <br />
                Altering or deleting stored data;[15] Other forms of fraud may
                be facilitated using computer systems, including bank fraud,
                carding, identity theft, extortion, and theft of classified
                information. These types of crime often result in the loss of
                private information or monetary information.

                <br />
                <br />
                Government officials and information technology security
                specialists have documented a significant increase in Internet
                problems and server scams since early 2001. There is a growing
                concern among government agencies such as the Federal Bureau of
                Investigation (FBI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
                that such intrusions are part of an organized effort by
                cyberterrorist foreign intelligence services, or other groups to
                map potential security holes in critical systems.[16] A
                cyberterrorist is someone who intimidates or coerces a
                government or an organization to advance his or her political or
                social objectives by launching a computer-based attack against
                computers, networks, or the information stored on them.
                Cyberterrorism, in general, can be defined as an act of
                terrorism committed through the use of cyberspace or computer
                resources (Parker 1983). As such, a simple propaganda piece on
                the Internet that there will be bomb attacks during the holidays
                can be considered cyberterrorism. There are also hacking
                activities directed towards individuals, families, organized by
                groups within networks, tending to cause fear among people,
                demonstrate power, collecting information relevant for ruining
                peoples' lives, robberies, blackmailing, etc.[17]

                CyberextortionEdit
                <br />
                <br />
                Main article: Extortion
                <br />
                <br />
                Cyberextortion occurs when a website, e-mail server, or computer
                system is subjected to or threatened with repeated denial of
                service or other attacks by malicious hackers. These hackers
                demand money in return for promising to stop the attacks and to
                offer "protection". According to the Federal Bureau of
                Investigation, cybercrime extortionists are increasingly
                attacking corporate websites and networks, crippling their
                ability to operate and demanding payments to restore their
                service. More than 20 cases are reported each month to the FBI
                and many go unreported in order to keep the victim's name out of
                the public domain. Perpetrators typically use a distributed
                denial-of-service attack.[18] However, other cyberextortion
                techniques exist such as doxing extortion and bug poaching.
                <br />
                <br />
                An example of cyberextortion was the attack on Sony Pictures of
                2014.[19] Ransomware is a kind of cyberextortion in which a
                malware is used to restrict access to files, sometimes
                threatening permanent data erasure unless a ransom is paid.
                Kapersky Lab 2016 Security Bulletin report estimates that a
                business falls victim of Ransomware every 40 minutes. [20] and
                predicted to attack a business every 11 minutes in 2021. With
                Ransomware remaining one of the fastest growing cybercrimes in
                the world, global Ransomware damage is predicted to cost up to
                $20 billion in 2021.[21]

                <br />
                <br />
                Cybersex trafficking is the transportation of victims and then
                the live streaming of coerced sexual acts and or rape on
                webcam.[22][23][24][25] Victims are abducted, threatened, or
                deceived and transferred to 'cybersex dens.'[26][27][28] The
                dens can be in any location where the cybersex traffickers have
                a computer, tablet, or phone with internet connection. [24]
                Perpetrators use social media networks, videoconferences, dating
                pages, online chat rooms, apps, dark web sites,[29] and other
                platforms.[30] They use online payment systems[29] [31][32] and
                cryptocurrencies to hide their identities.[33] Millions of
                reports of its occurrence are sent to authorities annually.[34]
                New legislation and police procedures are needed to combat this
                type of cybercrime.[35]
                <br />
                <br />
                An example of cybersex trafficking is the 2018–2020 Nth room
                case in South Korea.[36]

                The U.S. Department of Defense notes that the cyberspace has
                emerged as a national-level concern through several recent
                events of geostrategic significance. Among those are included,
                the attack on Estonia's infrastructure in 2007, allegedly by
                Russian hackers. In August 2008, Russia again allegedly
                conducted cyber attacks, this time in a coordinated and
                synchronized kinetic and non-kinetic campaign against the
                country of Georgia. Fearing that such attacks may become the
                norm in future warfare among nation-states, the concept of
                cyberspace operations impacts and will be adapted by warfighting
                military commanders in the future.[37]

                Computer as a targetEdit
                <br />
                <br />
                These crimes are committed by a selected group of criminals.
                Unlike crimes using the computer as a tool, these crimes require
                the technical knowledge of the perpetrators. As such, as
                technology evolves, so too does the nature of the crime. These
                crimes are relatively new, having been in existence for only as
                long as computers have—which explains how unprepared society and
                the world, in general, is towards combating these crimes. There
                are numerous crimes of this nature committed daily on the
                internet. It is seldom committed by loners, instead it involves
                large syndicate groups.
                <br />
                <br />
                Crimes that primarily target computer networks include:
                <br />
                <br />

                <br />
                When the individual is the main target of cybercrime, the
                computer can be considered as the tool rather than the target.
                These crimes generally involve less technical expertise. Human
                weaknesses are generally exploited. The damage dealt is largely
                psychological and intangible, making legal action against the
                variants more difficult. These are the crimes which have existed
                for centuries in the offline world. Scams, theft, and the likes
                have existed even before the development in high-tech equipment.
                The same criminal has simply been given a tool which increases
                their potential pool of victims and makes them all the harder to
                trace and apprehend. [38]
                <br />
                <br />
                Crimes that use computer networks or devices to advance other
                ends include: Fraud and identity theft (although this
                increasingly uses malware, hacking or phishing, making it an
                example of both "computer as target" and "computer as tool"
                crime)

                <br />
                Phishing is mostly propagated via email. Phishing emails may
                contain links to other websites that are affected by
                malware.[39] Or, they may contain links to fake online banking
                or other websites used to steal private account information.

                Obscene or offensive contentEdit
                <br />
                <br />
                The content of websites and other electronic communications may
                be distasteful, obscene or offensive for a variety of reasons.
                In some instances, these communications may be illegal. The
                extent to which these communications are unlawful varies greatly
                between countries, and even within nations. It is a sensitive
                area in which the courts can become involved in arbitrating
                between groups with strong beliefs.

                One area of Internet pornography that has been the target of the
                strongest efforts at curtailment is child pornography, which is
                illegal in most jurisdictions in the world. Debarati Halder and
                K. Jaishankar further define cybercrime from the perspective of
                gender and defined 'cybercrime against women' as "Crimes
                targeted against women with a motive to intentionally harm the
                victim psychologically and physically, using modern
                telecommunication networks such as internet and mobile
                phones".[40]

                Ad-fraudEdit

                See also: Ad fraud and Click fraud
                <br />
                <br />
                Ad-frauds are particularly popular among cybercriminals, as such
                frauds are less likely to be prosecuted and are particularly
                lucrative cybercrimes.[41] Jean-Loup Richet, Professor at the
                Sorbonne Business School, classified the large variety of
                ad-fraud observed in cybercriminal communities into three
                categories: (1) identity fraud; (2) attribution fraud; and (3)
                ad-fraud services.[14]
                <br />
                <br />
                Identity fraud aims to impersonate real users and inflate
                audience numbers. Several ad-fraud techniques relate to this
                category and include traffic from bots (coming from a hosting
                company or a data center, or from compromised devices); cookie
                stuffing; falsifying user characteristics, such as location and
                browser type; fake social traffic (misleading users on social
                networks into visiting the advertised website); and the creation
                of fake social signals to make a bot look more legitimate, for
                instance by opening a Twitter or Facebook account. Attribution
                fraud aims to impersonate real users’ behaviors (clicks,
                activities, conversations, etc.). Multiple ad-fraud techniques
                belong to this category: hijacked devices and the use of
                infected users (through a malware) as part of a botnet to
                participate in ad fraud campaigns; click farms (companies where
                low-wage employees are paid to click or engage in conversations
                and affiliates’ offers); incentivized browsing; video placement
                abuse (delivered in display banner slots); hidden ads (that will
                never be viewed by real users); domain spoofing (ads served on a
                website other than the advertised real-time bidding website);
                and clickjacking (user is forced to click on the ad).
                <br />
                <br />
                Ad fraud services are related to all online infrastructure and
                hosting services that might be needed to undertake identity or
                attribution fraud . Services can involve the creation of spam
                websites (fake networks of websites created to provide
                artificial backlinks); link building services; hosting services;
                creation of fake and scam pages impersonating a famous brand and
                used as part of an ad fraud campaign. A successful ad-fraud
                campaign involves a sophisticated combination of these three
                types of ad-fraud—sending fake traffic through bots using fake
                social accounts and falsified cookies; bots will click on the
                ads available on a scam page that is faking a famous brand.

                The examples and perspective in this section may not represent a
                worldwide view of the subject. (March 2016) Whereas content may
                be offensive in a non-specific way, harassment directs
                obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals
                focusing for example on gender, race, religion, nationality,
                sexual orientation.

                There are instances where committing a crime using a computer
                can lead to an enhanced sentence. For example, in the case of
                United States v. Neil Scott Kramer, the defendant was given an
                enhanced sentence according to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines
                Manual §2G1.3(b)(3) for his use of a cell phone to "persuade,
                induce, entice, coerce, or facilitate the travel of, the minor
                to engage in prohibited sexual conduct." Kramer appealed the
                sentence on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to
                convict him under this statute because his charge included
                persuading through a computer device and his cellular phone
                technically is not a computer. Although Kramer tried to argue
                this point, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual states that
                the term 'computer' "means an electronic, magnetic, optical,
                electrochemical, or other high-speed data processing device
                performing logical, arithmetic, or storage functions, and
                includes any data storage facility or communications facility
                directly related to or operating in conjunction with such
                device."
                <br />
                <br />
                In the United States alone, Missouri and over 40 other states
                have passed laws and regulations that regard extreme online
                harassment as a criminal act. These acts can be punished on a
                federal scale, such as US Code 18 Section 2261A, which states
                that using computers to threaten or harass can lead to a
                sentence of up to 20 years, depending on the action taken.[42]
                Several countries outside of the United States have also created
                laws to combat online harassment. In China, a country that
                supports over 20 percent of the world's internet users, the
                Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council passed a strict
                law against the bullying of young people through a bill in
                response to the Human Flesh Search Engine.[43][44] The United
                Kingdom passed the Malicious Communications Act, among other
                acts from 1997 to 2013, which stated that sending messages or
                letters electronically that the government deemed "indecent or
                grossly offensive" and/or language intended to cause "distress
                and anxiety" can lead to a prison sentence of six months and a
                potentially large fine.[45][46] Australia, while not directly
                addressing the issue of harassment, has grouped the majority of
                online harassment under the Criminal Code Act of 1995. Using
                telecommunication to send threats or harass and cause offense
                was a direct violation of this act.[47]

                Although freedom of speech is protected by law in most
                democratic societies (in the US this is done by the First
                Amendment), it does not include all types of speech. In fact,
                spoken or written "true threat" speech/text is criminalized
                because of "intent to harm or intimidate." That also applies for
                online or any type of network-related threats in written text or
                speech. Cyberbullying has increased drastically with the growing
                popularity of online social networking. As of January 2020, 44%
                of adult internet users in the United States have "personally
                experienced online harassment."[48] Children who experience
                online harassment deal with negative and sometimes
                life-threatening side effects. In 2021, reports displayed 41% of
                children developing social anxiety, 37% of children developing
                depression, and 26% of children having suicidal thoughts.[49]

                The United Arab Emirates was named in a spying scandal where the
                Gulf nation along with other repressive governments purchased
                NSO Group’s mobile spyware Pegasus for mass surveillance.
                Prominent activists and journalists were targeted as part of the
                campaign, including, Ahmed Mansoor, Princess Latifa, Princess
                Haya, and more. Ghada Oueiss was one of the many high-profile
                female journalists and activists who became the target of online
                harassment. Oueiss filed a lawsuit against the UAE ruler,
                Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan along with other defendants,
                accusing them of sharing her photos online. The defendants
                including the UAE ruler filed motions to dismiss the case of the
                hack-and-leak attack.[50]

                Drug traffickingEdit
                <br />
                <br />
                Darknet markets are used to buy and sell recreational drugs
                online. Some drug traffickers use encrypted messaging tools to
                communicate with drug mules. The dark web site Silk Road was a
                major online marketplace for drugs before it was shut down by
                law enforcement (then reopened under new management, and then
                shut down by law enforcement again). After Silk Road 2.0 went
                down, Silk Road 3 Reloaded emerged. However, it was just an
                older marketplace named Diabolus Market, that used the name for
                more exposure from the brand's previous success.[51]
                <br />
                <br />
                Darknet markets have had an up-rise in traffic in recent years
                for many reasons. One of the biggest contributors being the
                anonymity and safety that goes along when using the markets.
                [52] There are numerous ways you can lose all your money
                invested and be caught when using Darknet markets. Vendors and
                customers alike go to great lengths to keep their identities a
                secret while online. Commonly used tools are virtual private
                networks, Tails, and Tor to help hide their trail left behind
                for investigators. Darknet markets make the user feel safe as
                they can get what they want from the comfort of their home.
                People can easily gain access to a Tor browser with DuckDuckGo
                browser that allows a user to explore much deeper than other
                browsers such as Google Chrome. However actually gaining access
                to an illicit market isn't as simple as typing it in on the
                search engine like you would with google. Darknet markets have
                special links that are changing everyday ending in .onion
                opposed to the typical .com, .net. and .org domain extensions.
                To add to privacy the biggest currency on these markets is
                Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows transactions to be committed between
                people by exchanging wallet addresses and never having to know
                anything about the person you're sending money to.[53]
                <br />
                <br />
                One of the biggest issues the users face who use marketplaces
                are the vendors or market itself exit scamming.[54] This is when
                usually a vendor with a high rating will act as if they're still
                selling on the market and have users send them money.[55] The
                vendor will then close off his account after receiving money
                from multiple buyers and never send what they purchased. The
                vendors all being involved in illegal activities have a low
                chance at not exit scamming when they no longer want to be a
                vendor. In 2019, an entire market called Wall Street Market had
                allegedly exit scammed, stealing 30 million dollars from the
                vendors and buyers wallets in bitcoin.[56] Federal agents have
                had a huge crackdown on these markets. In July 2017, federal
                agents seized one of the biggest markets commonly called
                Alphabay which ironically later re-opened in August 2021 under
                the control of one of the original administrators
                DeSnake.[57][58] Commonly investigators will pose as a buyer and
                order packages from darknet vendors in the hopes they left a
                trail they can follow. One investigation had an investigator
                pose as a firearms seller and for six months people purchased
                from them and provided home addresses.[59] They were able to
                make over a dozen arrests during this six-month
                investigation.[59] Another one of law enforcement's biggest
                crackdowns are on vendors selling fentanyl and opiates. With
                thousands of dying each year due to drug over dose it was long
                overdue for law enforcement to crack down on these markets.[60]
                Many vendors don't realize the extra charges that go along with
                selling drugs online. Commonly they get charged with money
                laundering and charges for when the drugs are shipped in the
                mail on top of being a drug distributor.[61] Each state has its
                laws and regulations on drugs therefore vendors have the face
                multiple charges from different states. In 2019, a vendor was
                sentenced to 10 years in prison after selling cocaine and
                methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife.[62] Although many
                investigators spend a lot of time tracking down people in the
                course of a year only 65 suspects were identified who bought and
                sold illegal goods on some of the biggest markets.[63] This is
                compared to the thousands of transactions taking place daily on
                these markets.

                One of the highest profiled banking computer crime occurred
                during a course of three years beginning in 1970. The chief
                teller at the Park Avenue branch of New York's Union Dime
                Savings Bank embezzled over $1.5 million from hundreds of
                accounts.[64] A hacking group called MOD (Masters of Deception),
                allegedly stole passwords and technical data from Pacific Bell,
                Nynex, and other telephone companies as well as several big
                credit agencies and two major universities. The damage caused
                was extensive, one company, Southwestern Bell suffered losses of
                $370,000 alone.[64] In 1983, a 19-year-old UCLA student used his
                PC to break into a Defense Department International
                Communications system.[64]

                Between 1995 and 1998 the Newscorp satellite pay to view
                encrypted SKY-TV service was hacked several times during an
                ongoing technological arms race between a pan-European hacking
                group and Newscorp. The original motivation of the hackers was
                to watch Star Trek reruns in Germany; which was something which
                Newscorp did not have the copyright to allow. [65]

                On 26 March 1999, the Melissa worm infected a document on a
                victim's computer, then automatically sent that document and a
                copy of the virus spread via e-mail to other people. In February
                2000, an individual going by the alias of MafiaBoy began a
                series denial-of-service attacks against high-profile websites,
                including Yahoo!, Dell, Inc., E*TRADE, eBay, and CNN. About 50
                computers at Stanford University, and also computers at the
                University of California at Santa Barbara, were amongst the
                zombie computers sending pings in DDoS attacks. On 3 August
                2000, Canadian federal prosecutors charged MafiaBoy with 54
                counts of illegal access to computers, plus a total of ten
                counts of mischief to data for his attacks. The Stuxnet worm
                corrupted SCADA microprocessors, particularly of the types used
                in Siemens centrifuge controllers. The Flame (malware) that
                mainly targeted Iranian officials in an attempt to obtain
                sensitive information.[66]

                The Russian Business Network (RBN) was registered as an internet
                site in 2006. Initially, much of its activity was legitimate.
                But apparently, the founders soon discovered that it was more
                profitable to host illegitimate activities and started hiring
                its services to criminals. The RBN has been described by
                VeriSign as "the baddest of the bad".[67] It offers web hosting
                services and internet access to all kinds of criminal and
                objectionable activities, with individual activities earning up
                to $150 million in one year. It specialized in and in some cases
                monopolized personal identity theft for resale. It is the
                originator of MPack and an alleged operator of the now-defunct
                Storm botnet.

                On 2 March 2010, Spanish investigators arrested 3 men who were
                suspected of infecting of over 13 million computers around the
                world. The "botnet" of infected computers included PCs inside
                more than half of the Fortune 1000 companies and more than 40
                major banks, according to investigators.[68]

                In August 2010 the international investigation Operation Delego,
                operating under the aegis of the Department of Homeland
                Security, shut down the international pedophile ring Dreamboard.
                The website had approximately 600 members and may have
                distributed up to 123 terabytes of child pornography (roughly
                equivalent to 16,000 DVDs). To date this is the single largest
                U.S. prosecution of an international child pornography ring; 52
                arrests were made worldwide.[69] In January 2012 Zappos.com
                experienced a security breach after as many as 24 million
                customers' credit card numbers, personal information, billing
                and shipping addresses had been compromised.[70]

                1.5 million EHarmony passwords were posted online.[71]

                December 2012 Wells Fargo website experienced a denial of
                service attack. Potentially compromising 70 million customers
                and 8.5 million active viewers. Other banks thought to be
                compromised: Bank of America, J. P. Morgan U.S. Bank, and PNC
                Financial Services.[72] 23 April 2013 saw the Associated Press'
                Twitter account's hacked - the hacker posted a hoax tweet about
                fictitious attacks in the White House that they claimed left
                President Obama injured. [73] This hoax tweet resulted in a
                brief plunge of 130 points from the Dow Jones Industrial
                Average, removal of $136 billion from S&P 500 index,[74] and the
                temporary suspension of AP's Twitter account. The Dow Jones
                later restored its session gains. In May 2017, 74 countries
                logged a ransomware cybercrime, called "WannaCry"[75] Illicit
                access to camera sensors, microphone sensors, phonebook
                contacts, all internet-enabled apps, and metadata of mobile
                telephones running Android and IOS were reportedly made
                accessible by Israeli spyware, found to be being in operation in
                at least 46 nation-states around the world. Journalists, Royalty
                and government officials were amongst the targets.[76][77] [78]
                Previous accusations of cases of Israeli-weapons companies
                meddling in international telephony[79] and smartphones[80] have
                been eclipsed in the 2018 reported case. In December 2019, the
                United States intelligence and an investigation by The New York
                Times revealed that messaging application of the United Arab
                Emirates, ToTok is a spying tool. The research revealed that the
                Emirati government attempted to track every conversation,
                movement, relationship, appointment, sound and image of those
                who install the app on their phones.

                goes along when using the markets.[52] There are numerous ways
                you can lose all your money invested and be caught when using
                Darknet markets. Vendors and customers alike go to great lengths
                to keep their identities a secret while online. Commonly used
                tools are virtual private networks, Tails, and Tor to help hide
                their trail left behind for investigators. Darknet markets make
                the user feel safe as they can get what they want from the
                comfort of their home. People can easily gain access to a Tor
                browser with DuckDuckGo browser that allows a user to explore
                much deeper than other browsers such as Google Chrome. However
                actually gaining access to an illicit market isn't as simple as
                typing it in on the search engine like you would with google.
                Darknet markets have special links that are changing everyday
                ending in .onion opposed to the typical .com, .net. and .org
                domain extensions. To add to privacy the biggest currency on
                these markets is Bitcoin. Bitcoin allows transactions to be
                committed between people by exchanging wallet addresses and
                never having to know anything about the person you're sending
                money to.[53]

                One of the biggest issues the users face who use marketplaces
                are the vendors or market itself exit scamming.[54] This is when
                usually a vendor with a high rating will act as if they're still
                selling on the market and have users send them money.[55] The
                vendor will then close off his account after receiving money
                from multiple buyers and never send what they purchased. The
                vendors all being involved in illegal activities have a low
                chance at not exit scamming when they no longer want to be a
                vendor. In 2019, an entire market called Wall Street Market had
                allegedly exit scammed, stealing 30 million dollars from the
                vendors and buyers wallets in bitcoin.[56] Federal agents have
                had a huge crackdown on these markets. In July 2017, federal
                agents seized one of the biggest markets commonly called
                Alphabay which ironically later re-opened in August 2021 under
                the control of one of the original administrators
                DeSnake.[57][58] Commonly investigators will pose as a buyer and
                order packages from darknet vendors in the hopes they left a
                trail they can follow. One investigation had an investigator
                pose as a firearms seller and for six months people purchased
                from them and provided home addresses.[59] They were able to
                make over a dozen arrests during this six-month
                investigation.[59] Another one of law enforcement's biggest
                crackdowns are on vendors selling fentanyl and opiates. With
                thousands of dying each year due to drug over dose it was long
                overdue for law enforcement to crack down on these markets.[60]
                Many vendors don't realize the extra charges that go along with
                selling drugs online. Commonly they get charged with money
                laundering and charges for when the drugs are shipped in the
                mail on top of being a drug distributor.[61] Each state has its
                laws and regulations on drugs therefore vendors have the face
                multiple charges from different states. In 2019, a vendor was
                sentenced to 10 years in prison after selling cocaine and
                methamphetamine under the name JetSetLife.[62] Although many
                investigators spend a lot of time tracking down people in the
                course of a year only 65 suspect
